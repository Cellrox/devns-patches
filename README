Device namespaces are an extension to existing Linux kernel namespaces,
developed by Cellrox as part of its Thinvisor technology for lightweight
virtualization for mobile devices.

Device namespaces are based on development done at Columbia University. Certain
portions are copyrighted by Columbia University.

Device namespaces create the illusion, for processes inside a namespace, that
they interact exclusively with a set of device drivers, hiding the fact that
there are other namespaces interacting with the same set of device drivers.

Device namespaces also introduce the concept of an active namespace, which is
a namespace with access to real devices/peripherals and with which the user
interacts, and the concept of switching namespaces to allow users to interact
with multiple namespaces, one at a time.
